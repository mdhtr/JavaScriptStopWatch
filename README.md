Stopwatch / Stopper / Timer / Time Tracker - User Script - in a floating, draggable div box

The goal of this project is to create a userscript that can be used with Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey and supports measuring and logging time worked on issues in some kind of issue and/or time tracking system.

The stopwatch should have this basic functionality:
* stopwatch: start time measurement, stop time measurement, display elapsed time
* display: floating, draggable div box that has the start/stop controls and shows the actual elapsed time
